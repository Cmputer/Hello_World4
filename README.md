# Hello_World4
This is an equivalent repository written in Assembly Language to showcase different languages.

## Description
This repositiory contains a HelloWorld.asm file. This is a simple GitHub repo that is supposed to show how one looks and
explain how to clone this repo onto your own GitHub. Once you do this and understand the Git commands, you will be able to 
make your own private repos to display your work. 

This program uses the x86 assembly language and Linux system calls to accomplish its tasks. It first prints "Hello, World!" 
to the console using the write system call. It then prints a prompt and reads input from the user using the read system call.

It then enters a loop that continues until the input is empty, checking the first character of the input buffer at each 
iteration. If the input is not empty, it prints an error message and reads input again. Once the input is empty, it calls a 
subroutine to print the message and exits the program.
